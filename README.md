# 2. INTRODUCTION
<a name="introduction"></a>
<p align="justify">
In Vietnam, alongside the urbanization process, the concentration of the population in major cities such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang is increasing. The rise in population has significantly impacted the development of these cities, leading to environmental pollution and shortages of resources such as clean water, land, space, and energy.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The reality demonstrates that urban areas in Vietnam are experiencing robust development, particularly in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Urban development must align with smart solutions to meet the escalating needs of the population. The construction of smart cities has become increasingly crucial for Vietnam. In this context, on August 1, 2018, the Prime Minister issued Decision No. 950/QD-TTg approving the Sustainable Smart Urban Development Project in Vietnam for the period 2018–2025 with a vision to 2030.
</p>
<p align="justify">
However, the current construction and development of smart cities (Smart City) in Vietnam are facing numerous challenges such as integration, urban competition, climate change, rising sea levels, and sustainable development coupled with green growth. Complex issues arising from the urbanization process and urban development, including wealth disparity, housing, employment, suburban development, urban-rural connectivity (regional connectivity), and conservation of natural resources, pose significant challenges.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Additionally, public awareness regarding smart city development in Vietnam is currently limited. Despite the concept of smart cities having emerged nearly 20 years ago globally, there is still ongoing debate and a lack of consensus. To provide suggestions for the development of Smart City in Vietnam, this article explores perspectives on global smart city development, discusses the smart city development model in Vietnam, and proposes recommendations.

# 4. THE CURRENT SITUATION OF HANOI CITY
<a name="thecurrentsituationofhanoicity"></a>
Hanoi has made progress in applying information technology, which is a fundamental premise for moving towards building a smart city.

## 4.1. DEVELOPMENT STATUS OF SMART CITY IN HANOI.
<a name="developmentstatusofsmartcityinhanoi"></a>
The fifth session of the Hanoi City People's Council on December 4, 2017, decided to adjust the goals of applying information technology in the period 2016-2020, aiming to transform Hanoi into a Smart City by 2030.
<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="https://i.imgur.com/xyGSoQ1.png" alt="Hanoi's orientation towards building Smart City 2030">
</p>
<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 2: Hanoi's orientation towards building Smart City 2030</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">Hanoi has prioritized four sectors: healthcare, education, transportation, and tourism in building Smart City. In 2017, all these areas began implementation, combined with the development of e-government, administrative reform, forming the foundation for building a Smart City.</p>
<p align="justify">In terms of urban transportation, Hanoi has introduced the Iparking smart application for convenient car parking, allowing users to find and pay for parking through their phones. This application has been deployed in all districts of Hanoi.</p>
<p align="justify">Additionally, the digital traffic map system of Hanoi is being urgently put into operation to provide information on traffic conditions and manage public passenger transport in the area.</p>
<p align="justify">In education, the electronic grade book and communication book system has been used, along with the online enrollment system for more than 2,700 schools and 250,000 families participating, with over 6.3 million accesses to the online enrollment portal. The current registration rate for online profiles for all three levels of education is 70.68%...</p>
<p align="justify">In health management, Hanoi is the first locality to widely deploy the electronic health record management system. Nearly 900,000 health records have been established.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, a database of over 8 million residents of the Capital has been built to deploy applications, services for citizens, businesses, and the city's operational activities. The city's electronic communication portal also provides information on air quality, West Lake water environment, rainfall, and flood maps...</p>

## 4.2. CHALLENGES
<a name="challenges"></a>
<p align="justify">
Due to wars and the period of subsidies, Hanoi has lagged behind in modernization for many decades. Nowadays, Hanoi is continuously expanding, aiming to become an international city with a smart orientation. Globalization trends and fierce competition among major cities, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, have brought significant changes to Hanoi in various fields, while also posing new challenges for governance, attracting investment, opening up to integration, and emphasizing sustainable development.</p>
<p align="justify">
As of April 1, 2019, the total population of Hanoi is over 8 million people (2.22 million households). On average, the capital's population increases by about 160,000 people each year, equivalent to a large district. The population growth is putting pressure on the urban transportation system, healthcare, education, environment, urban culture, and housing in the capital.</p>
<p align="justify">
Weak transportation and logistics are the major issues in Hanoi. Public transportation such as buses, with a low number of users, mainly consists of students, elderly people, and very few adults, as most people rely on personal vehicles. Therefore, the large number of vehicles on the road (about 7 million motorbikes and 1 million cars) has put immense pressure on Hanoi's infrastructure. Additionally, the city is witnessing the surge of new means of transportation such as bicycles, electric scooters, and technology-based transport services like Grab. All these factors contribute to the increasing and complex traffic situation in Hanoi.</p>

## 4.3. ISSUES
<a name="issues"></a>
<p align="justify">
Currently, Hanoi is in a favorable position for building a Smart City. It is easy to attract investments from both domestic and international corporations such as Viettel, VNPT, FPT, CMC, and major foreign companies like Microsoft, Dell.</p>
<p align="justify">
Countries with experience in building Smart Cities, such as Singapore, are also eager to cooperate with Hanoi in these areas. Prime Minister Ly Hien Long, during a meeting with Hanoi's leadership, expressed Singapore's desire to collaborate with Hanoi in investing and developing high-tech zones, software industry, and promoting cooperation in the field of Smart City.</p>
<p align="justify">
Singapore is willing to facilitate the participation of officials from Hanoi and Vietnam in training courses in Singapore, including at the Ly Quang Dieu School of Public Administration.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Moreover, Hanoi has several advantages that other localities may not have, such as intellectual potential with nearly 80% of professors, associate professors, over 80% of leading experts, and over one-third of universities and research institutes working directly in the area. Of course, Hanoi still faces many challenges and difficulties on the path to building a Smart City. In addition to challenges related to outdated ICT technical infrastructure, general technical infrastructure is causing congestion in traffic, water shortages, flooding of wastewater, rainwater, and environmental pollution from waste.</p>
<p align="justify">
According to Hoang Trung Hai, Secretary of the Hanoi Party Committee, another core challenge is how to have a workforce of sufficient quality to meet the needs of Smart City and operate e-government. Technology is a crucial platform for Smart City, creating connections between the government, businesses, and citizens. However, human resources ultimately determine the success or failure of Smart City.</p>
<p align="justify">
Despite these challenges, in recent times, Hanoi has made significant preparations on a solid foundation for building a Smart City according to the outlined plan. Recently, the People's Council of the city passed a resolution adjusting the "Program on the Application of Information Technology Objectives in the Activities of State Agencies in Hanoi City in the 2016-2020 period.</p>
<p align="justify">
With the adjusted implementation budget increased from 1,252 billion VND to 3,000 billion VND, the program is a crucial platform for Hanoi to develop e-government, Smart City, and comprehensively advance economic and social sectors.</p>
<p align="justify">
Secretary of the Hanoi Party Committee also demanded that the Hanoi authorities firmly implement the three breakthrough stages that the Party Committee of the city has set for 2018. These stages include synchronously developing the modernization of urban and rural infrastructure, intensifying administrative reforms, improving the investment environment, and enhancing the quality of human resources. These breakthroughs will have a significant impact on the speed of achieving the goal of making Hanoi a Smart City by 2030.</p>

## 4.4. CORE ELEMENTS TO UPGRADE HANOI TO SMART CITY
<a name="core-elements-to-upgrade-hanoi-to-smart-city"></a>
<p align="justify">
Firstly, Hanoi needs a modern information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure that fully covers the city. The ICT system ensures that the city becomes an "Internet of Things" (IoT) environment. This means that through ICT support, residents in the city can connect with nature, homes, roads, trees, kitchens, vehicles, and more. To achieve this, high-tech devices such as sensors, cameras, high-speed wireless networks, fiber optic transmissions, large data processing, extremely fast speeds, and interconnected applications in technical and non-technical fields are required. Additionally, automation applications in production and daily life, such as robots and unmanned vehicles, are essential.</p>
<p align="justify">
Secondly, it is necessary to plan and construct modern infrastructure. Areas such as transportation, hospitals, schools, etc., must be integrated into intelligent applications and carefully planned within the urban management system.</p>
<p align="justify">
Thirdly, smart citizens must have sufficient employment opportunities with high incomes. This is considered one of the decisive factors for the success of a Smart City.</p>
<p align="justify">
Fourthly, there needs to be a team of highly skilled, comprehensive, and dedicated experts to manage and operate the technical system of the Smart City.</p>
<p align="justify">
Fifthly, a "smart government" or "smart leadership" is essential. This includes individuals with competence, integrity, transparency, who make informed decisions, prioritize key areas, determine appropriate investment levels, and know how to sustain long-term success for the Smart City.</p>

## 4.5. HANOI SMART CITY DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
<a name="hanoi-smart-city-development-roadmap"></a>
The Smart City development plan for Hanoi is divided into three main stages:
- Stage 1 (2016-2020):
  - Formation of basic components such as infrastructure foundations.
  - Construction of intelligent systems in various sectors: transportation, government, economy, education, etc.
- Stage 2 (2020-2025):
  - Focus on placing citizens at the center of development.
  - Concentration on constructing high-tech residential areas where citizens actively participate in management.
  - Formation of a digital economy.
- Stage 3 (2025-2030):
  - Hanoi aims to become a highly developed Smart City.

<p align="justify">These stages indicate a progressive development approach, starting with the establishment of fundamental components, moving towards citizen-centric urban planning and the integration of advanced technologies, and finally, achieving a high level of smart city development by 2030.</p>

  <em>Figure 8: The system of 110 cameras on the Hanoi – Lao Cai expressway</em>
</p>

`Inner Hanoi` 
<p align="justify">Currently, Hanoi has about 400 cameras connected to 46 screens located at the Hanoi Traffic Signal Control Center. When signals indicate congestion or issues on a particular road, the center will determine the traffic flow direction to resolve the situation promptly.</p>
<p align="justify">In the near future, the Hanoi Police will collaborate with the Department of Transport to propose further development of peripheral devices and priority systems for buses, ambulances, firefighting vehicles, etc., to optimize traffic conditions.</p>
<p align="justify">This priority system is currently being tested on the Kim Ma - Yen Nghia bus route. On this route, when a bus passes through intersections with red traffic lights, the signal will prioritize the bus to minimize the travel time from the starting point to the destination, avoiding traffic congestion as much as possible.</p>
  
### 5.1.3. VOV'S CCTV SYSTEM
<a name="vovcctvsystem"></a>
<p align="justify">The road monitoring system utilizes cameras installed on all streets of Hanoi by the Voice of Vietnam (VOV) radio station. The images collected by the system are transmitted in real-time to law enforcement agencies and the VOV system, providing information on traffic jams, accidents, or construction sites affecting traffic. VOV will then notify users through radio broadcasts, the internet, or directly on the radio system of vehicles.</p>

## 5.3. PAPERLESS GOVERNMENT MEETING ROOM
<a name="paperlessgovernmentmeetingroom"></a>
<p align="justify">Viettel Solution (VTS) has collaborated with the Hanoi government to build an e-government ecosystem utilizing information technology to automate government processes. This initiative aims to streamline administrative procedures, save time, and enable government agencies to provide high-quality public services while reducing national budget expenditures.</p>
